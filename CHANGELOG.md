# Changelog

## Documentation

### Added

- `docs/AGENT_REFERENCE.md` - full CLI/JSON reference for
  `hydra-umc-agent` (`describe`/`health`/`serve`), documenting every real
  output field and how `state`/`checks.*` are derived, plus the
  `--config` file's exact schema. Verified live against the running
  agent. Linked from `docs/SERVICE_MODEL.md`. Documentation-only - no
  code changed, no version bump.
